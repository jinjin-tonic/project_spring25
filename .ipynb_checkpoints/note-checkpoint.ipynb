    "Topic: Gacha Mechanics Analysis using Bayesian inference from observed roll outcomes in Honkai: Star Rail\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Abstract: Add a one-line summary of preliminary findings.\n",
    "1. Introduction: introduce the purpose of the analysis\n",
    "   - What is the pity system?\n",
    "   - What is the known probabilty based on the developer's description?\n",
    "   - “This project investigates whether the observed gacha roll outcomes align with the official stated probabilities, and whether Bayesian inference can uncover hidden patterns or validate game mechanics.”\n",
    "   - To define clear:\n",
    "       - The known rates (\"0.6% base chance for 5★, increasing after 75 pulls\").\n",
    "       - Explain the “soft pity” mechanism and “hard pity” ceiling (i.e. guaranteed 5★ by 90).\n",
    "       - Define what a \"pull\" is for the reader.\n",
    "2. Related Work: introduce the previous reddit posts\n",
    "3. Dataset: personal pull history of the last 6 months\n",
    "   - How many total pulls?\n",
    "   - Did you separate by banner type? (limited vs. standard)\n",
    "   - Did you reset pity between events?\n",
    "   - How do you handle time-based dependencies or streaks?\n",
    "   - Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Visualization\n",
    "       - Show empirical CDF of pulls until 5★.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bayesian Data Analysis\n",
    "   - 4.1 Model Setup\n",
    "       - Model for pulling a 5 star character.\n",
    "       - Pity-based modeling: is pull probability conditional on previous failed attempts?\n",
    "   - 4.2 Priors\n",
    "       - Known prior: based on developer’s official pity curve.\n",
    "       - Non-informative: flat prior.\n",
    "       - (Bonus) Empirical: learned prior from your pull history or reddit datasets.\n",
    "   - 4.3 Model Fitting\n",
    "       - Describe the likelihood structure.\n",
    "       - What are your observations (Bernoulli trials for success/failure)?\n",
    "       - Visualize posterior distributions.\n",
    "       - Overlay observed vs. expected soft pity curves.\n",
    "   - 4.4 Model Comparison\n",
    "       - LOO or WAIC comparison.\n",
    "       - Posterior predictive checks to validate model fit.\n",
    "   - 4.5 (optional) Exploration of Alternative Distributions\n",
    "       - Fit metalog or other flexible models.\n",
    "       - Compare shape with classical distributions (e.g. Geometric, Weibull, etc.).\n",
    "   - 4.6 Hierarchical Modeling\n",
    "       - Separate models for 4★ and 5★.\n",
    "       - Consider a shared structure where they both depend on pulls-since-last-hit.\n",
    "   - 4.7 Observations\n",
    "       - Any empirical curve that diverges from the known one?\n",
    "       - Estimate of hidden parameters (e.g., actual rate vs. stated rate)?\n",
    "5. Conclusion\n",
    "   - Summarize results and implications.\n",
    "   - Address: “Does the data support the official pity claims?”\n",
    "   - Mention limitations:\n",
    "       - Personal data only (sampling bias).\n",
    "       - Limited temporal coverage.\n",
    "   - Future work ideas:\n",
    "       - Larger sample size (community data).\n",
    "       - Compare across accounts."
